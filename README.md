This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
node server/server.js
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see a simple counter, and ``` /chat ``` to see the chat with websockets.

Websocket server is running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
